# Progress and Test Report 1

I implemented a very basic UI to support local notification.

![App user interface](Test/Test1/UI.png)

A user needs to *Request Notification Permission* when running the app first time.

To send out a a notification, press the *Car Honk Notification* button, and then lock the screen.

A notification will show up on the screen.

It will also show up on the paried apple watch.
